The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\n\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan\napproach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR.\n.\nRoles and Responsibilities: Development, Testing and support.\nSoftware Used: Oracle 9i\n\nOTHER PROJECTS AND REAL TIME TRAINING:\n\nRTRM(Railway Ticketing System Through Mobile)\nA mobile based real time application with many exciting features like checking pnr status, train\navailability, trains between stations etc. This application was done in j2me and it uses weblogic\nas server and MSSQL as the database.\n\nUndergone a mandatory Training on Finance By Oracle Corporation\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBirla Institute Of Technology -  Pilani, Rajasthan\n\n2011\n\nBachelor of Technology in Computer Science\n\nUniversity College Of Engineering, University Of Kerala\n\n2005 to 2009\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nSKILL SET:\n\n\n\nLanguages: Core Java\nFront end/GUI Tools programming: Adobe Flex, GWT\nDatabase: Oracle 10g\nIDE: Eclipse, FlexBuilder\nFrameWorks: Spring(Basics), MVC frame work\nOperating System: Windows, Linux, Unix", "Imgeeyaul Ansari\njava developer\n\nPune, Maharashtra - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Imgeeyaul-Ansari/a7be1cc43a434ac4\n\nWilling to relocate to: Pune, Maharashtra\n\nWORK EXPERIENCE\n\nApplication Developer\n\nOracle Financial Software Services -  Pune, Maharashtra -\n\nAugust 2016 to Present\n\n\u2022 Wrote Services in java using data annotation which in turn were used for creating other files\nusing code generation tool.\n\n\u2022 Jar of services with related utility files such as DTOs are deployed on the Host side.\n\n\u2022 Host side is hosted on Tomcat Server where proxy files are present.\n\n\u2022 Created jsff page for UI, and wrote action, helper, assembler, backing bean for UI side business\nLogic made entries in collectionAppModule, PageDef.\n\n\u2022 Used ADF & MVC architecture for building application.\n\nUsed JUnit for Testing services,Algorithms.\nAlso made test Suites For running multiple test case at one go.\n\nUsed Eclipse Debugger for Fixing Service Related Jiras.\nMade Use of Hot Deployment for Fixing Ui related Bugs on UI side which was run on Weblogic\nServer. \nUsed JAWS Reader for solving accessibility Related jiras and IA plugin.\n\nUsed Java to write Batches for fetching of Bulk Data at Regular Interval.\nIt created Thread for Multitasking to reduce the time for processing.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBachelor of Enginerring in Information Technology\n\nArmy institute of technology -  Pune, Maharashtra\n\n2012 to 2016\n\nCBSE in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics\n\nRashtriya Military School Bangalore -  Bengaluru, Karnataka\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/Imgeeyaul-Ansari/a7be1cc43a434ac4?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN\n\n\n2010 to 2011\n\nCBSE in Mathematics and English\n\nRashtriya Military School Bangalore -  Bengaluru, Karnataka\n\n2008 to 2009\n\nSKILLS\n\nJAVA (1 year), CSS (1 year), HTML (1 year), MYSQL (1 year), JAVASCRIPT (Less than 1 year),\nAngularjs (1 year), Oracle Pl/Sql\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTECHNICAL SKILLS\nProgramming Languages :C/C++, angular, java, java servlet, HTML, java script, MySQL, css, jsff.\n\nOperating Systems Linux, Windows, Android\n\nORM Eclipse Link, Hibernate\n\nFramework & tools :ADF, Eclipse, Android Studio, Git, Selenium, Code blocks, Net beans, R studio,\nTortoise SVN.", "Jay Madhavi\nNavi Mumbai, Maharashtra - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Jay-\nMadhavi/1e7d0305af766bf6\n\nI look forward to being associated with a growth - oriented, learning firm and\ncontribute my skills for its success.

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\napplications on a given network.\n\u2022 WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\n\n\n\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\n\u2022 The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\n\u2022 Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\ncheck.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.E in CSE\n\nANNA University\n\n2011\n\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n\n2005 to 2007\n\nSKILLS\n\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Skills\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux", "Yathishwaran P\nMaximo Consultant - Infosys Limited\n\nNamakkal, Tamil Nadu - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Yathishwaran-P/a9c8d42210af40b8\n\n\u2022 Maximo Consultant in Infosys Limited, Chennai from August 2013 till date (around 4.8 years)\n\u2022 IT professional with 4.4 years of experience in BIRT reporting, application support in IBM MAXIMO\nApplication.\n\u2022 IBM Certified MAXIMO ASSET MANAGEMENT, PURCHASE ORDER, PROCUREMENT, PURCHASE\nREQUISITION Professional\n\u2022 Submitted Internal tutorial document on Configuration of Hover Dialogs and Its usage in Maximo\nV7.6\n\u2022 Worked on various customer requirements and having overall experience with\n\u27a2 Preventive Maintenance\n\u27a2 Maximo automation and implementation\n\u27a2 MBO customizations\n\u27a2 Data Supply chain\n\u27a2 Portals, Workflows Designing\n\u27a2 Reports/Query Creation\n\u27a2 Work order tracking, Invoicing, Purchase order\n\u27a2 Asset Management\n\u27a2 Maximo Integration Framework (MIF)\n\u27a2 Labors, Crews, Security Group Set up\n\u27a2 Domains, Database configuration\n\u27a2 Basics of BIRT, Cognos Reporting, Monitor logs from Admin console.\n\u27a2 Maximo Java customization\n\u27a2 Maximo Installation/Upgradation\n\u27a2 Basic WebSphere function\n\n\u2022 Strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work in team efficiently.

It is a proprietary platform and has company internal\ncustomers. It has main two planes, system management and system service planes and several\nsub modules.\nI have successfully worked on the following modules.\n\nModule - MML INI Parser Tool\nMML is Configuration Tool used in communication equipments\nThis Configuration Tool has set of default and user defined commands. INI Parsing tool is a tool\nwhich accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File\nrespectively which will be read by server to resister the commands.\nInvolved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.\n\n\n\nModule - Man Machine Language\nMML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server\narchitecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment.\nIt receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process\nit. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back\nto the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization\nManagement, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing,\nLOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server.\nInvolved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - Configuration Management\nConfiguration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function\nis to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration\ntool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication\nmechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the\nfunctionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands\ncan be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type.\nConfiguration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be\nloaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications' static\nconfiguration data.\nInvolved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - TL1\nTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, \"legacy\", management protocol in\ntelecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is\nwidely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation\nsystem/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System\nLanguage (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing\nnetwork elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client.\nClient sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications.\nTL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR\n831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages\nback to TL1 Response messages\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead\nfor this project.\n\nModule - QX\nThe Qx interface is a company proprietary application layer protocol between target and the GUI\nof NMS. By this protocol, NE can communicate with SCC (System Communication and Control)\nsoftware in different operation system. Each command has defined format. Commands are given\nin binary form. Qx Module acts as an interface between the Client and Application.\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead\nfor this project.\n\nRole: Designer/Developer/ Reviewer/\n\n\n\nResponsibility: Designing and coding various modules Involvement in peer review and overall\nreview activities and project discussions Coordinating the development cycle Training team\nmembers and solving project related issues configuration management of the project using Clear\nCase\nDuration: From June 2004 to Sep 2006\nHardware: X86, CPCI, ATCA\nSoftware: C++, C\nProject2: Wireless LAN - 802.11 MAC (Split AP Architecture)\nDescription of the project\nWireless LAN 802.11 describes MAC and PHY. Wireless stations are connected to form a basic\nservice area which is controlled by a base station called Access Point.
